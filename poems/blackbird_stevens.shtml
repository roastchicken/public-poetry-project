                    Among twenty snowy mountains,<br>
                    The only moving thing<br>
                    Was the eye of the blackbird.<br>
                </p>

                <h3>

                </h3>
                <p>
                    I was of three minds,<br>
                    Like a tree<br>
                    In which there are three blackbirds.<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds.<br>
                    It was a small part of the pantomime.<br>
                </p>

                    A man and a woman<br>
                    Are one.<br>
                    A man and a woman and a blackbird<br>
                    Are one.<br>
                </p>

                <h3>

                <p>
                    I do not know which to prefer,<br>
                    The beauty of inflections<br>
                    Or the beauty of innuendoes,<br>
                    The blackbird whistling<br>
                    Or just after.<br>
                </p>

                    Icicles filled the long window<br>
                    With barbaric glass.<br>
                    The shadow of the blackbird<br>
                    Crossed it, to and fro.<br>
                    The mood<br>
                    Traced in the shadow<br>
                    An indecipherable cause.<br>
                </p>

                    O thin men of Haddam,<br>
                    Why do you imagine golden birds?<br>
                    Do you not see how the blackbird<br>
                    Walks around the feet<br>
                    Of the women about you?<br>
                </p>

                    I know noble accents<br>
                    And lucid, inescapable rhythms;<br>
                    But I know, too,<br>
                    That the blackbird is involved<br>
                    In what I know.<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    When the blackbird flew out of sight,<br>
                    It marked the edge<br>
                    Of one of many circles.<br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    At the sight of blackbirds<br>
                    Flying in a green light,<br>
                    Even the bawds of euphony<br>
                    Would cry out sharply.<br>
                </p>

                    He rode over Connecticut<br>
                    In a glass coach.<br>
                    Once, a fear pierced him,<br>
                    In that he mistook<br>
                    The shadow of his equipage<br>
                    For blackbirds.<br>
                </p>

                    The river is moving.<br>
                    The blackbird must be flying.<br>

                    It was evening all afternoon.<br>
                    It was snowing<br>
                    And it was going to snow.<br>
                    The blackbird sat<br>
                    In the cedar-limbs.<br>
