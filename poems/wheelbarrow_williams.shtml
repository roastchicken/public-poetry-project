                        <p>Please choose one of the stanzas below to interpret, and send an email to <a href="mailto:request@poetryart.org?subject=%22Thirteen%20Ways%20of%20Looking%20at%20a%20Blackbird%22%20by%20Wallace%20Stevens&body=Stanza%3A">request@poetryart.org</a> in order to request it.</p>

                    <p>
                        Stanza requests will be honored on a first come, first serve basis.
                        Please don't start on a piece without requesting the stanza first!
                        The goal is to combine all of the art into one big piece that represents the poem, and if there are duplicates that doesn't work as well.
